## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- Content-type aware text chunking with automatic HTML, Markdown, and plain text detection (#350, #142)
- Unified embedding generation with mean pooling for large content that exceeds model context limits
- Dedicated embedding commands: `embed_note`, `embed_insight`, `embed_source`
- New utility modules: `chunking.py` and `embedding.py` in `open_notebook/utils/`
- Japanese (ja-JP) language support (#450)

### Changed
- Embedding is now fire-and-forget: domain models submit embedding commands asynchronously after save
- `rebuild_embeddings_command` now delegates to individual embed_* commands instead of inline processing
- Chunk size reduced to 1500 characters for better compatibility with Ollama embedding models
- Bump Esperanto to 2.16 for increased Ollama context window support

### Removed
- Legacy embedding commands: `embed_single_item_command`, `embed_chunk_command`, `vectorize_source_command`
- `needs_embedding()` and `get_embedding_content()` methods from domain models
- `split_text()` function from text_utils (replaced by `chunk_text()` in chunking module)

### Fixed
- Embedding failures when content exceeds model context limits (#350, #142)
- Empty note titles when saving from chat (clean thinking tags from prompt graph output)
- Orphaned embedding/insight records when deleting sources (cascade delete)
- Search results crash with null parent_id (defensive frontend check)
- Database migration 10 cleans up existing orphaned records

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-15

### Performance
- Improved source listing speed by 20-30x (#436, closes #351)

  - Use SurrealDB `FETCH` clause for command status instead of N async calls

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
